# fast-delete-script
A python script to rapidly delete any folder files and directories. With two different modes of deleting.

Modes:
once - Runs the code once and stops after finishing deleting all the files from the selected folder
repeat - Script keeps awake waiting for files in the selected folder to delete

Files are completely deleted when running this code so make sure you don't need what you are going to delete because you won't be able to recover it
